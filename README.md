# LevelUpDiag for SemantiK Architect v1

**Profile version:** 2.2.0  
**Target:** `C:\mycode\SemantiK_Architect\SemantiK_Architect`  
**Mode:** read-oriented external-target diagnostics  
**Dependency policy:** standard-library diagnostic core; target tooling is invoked only when explicitly required by the profile

This LevelUpDiag profile is aligned with the clean SemantiK Architect v1 architecture, including the SemantiK Architect 1.2.0 Kristal v6 communication boundary.
It diagnoses **SA itself** as a deterministic semantic-to-human communication engine whose
canonical pipeline is:

```text
CommunicationRequest
  -> CommunicationPlanner
  -> CommunicationPlan
  -> lexical preflight
  -> LanguagePlanner
  -> LanguagePlan / RealizationUnit
  -> exact lexical binding
  -> versioned SA↔GF bridge
  -> PGF/GF
  -> CommunicationResult + coverage + RuntimeSet identity
```

The profile does not expect an `app/` tree, FastAPI, a frontend, a single hard-coded PGF,
`requirements.txt`, family grammar engines, or grammar-development code inside SA.

## Run

From this LevelUpDiag directory:

```bat
RUN_SEMANTIK_ARCHITECT_DIAG.bat semantik
RUN_SEMANTIK_ARCHITECT_DIAG.bat standard
```

Or directly:

```bat
python levelupdiag.py doctor
python levelupdiag.py run semantik
python levelupdiag.py run standard
python levelupdiag.py run deep --jobs 1
```

Evidence is written under the target repository:

```text
.levelupdiag/runs/<run-id>/
```

## Campaigns

- `baseline`: generic repository evidence only.
- `semantik`: SA v1 architecture/contracts/runtime-model diagnostics without executing the full target validator.
- `standard`: recommended campaign; adds the target's canonical `tools/validate_repository.py` validation.
- `deep`: adversarial campaign; adds declared validators plus S90–S120 mutation, fail-closed, determinism/concurrency and isolated packaging probes.

## SemantiK-specific levels

| ID | Diagnostic domain |
|---|---|
| S10 | Architecture Lock — required locks/schemas/source tree and one canonical architecture |
| S20 | Python Architecture Integrity — syntax/imports, hexagonal dependency direction, PGF confinement, no language-code branches |
| S30 | Contract & Schema Integrity — all schemas/examples plus executable Kristal v6 traceability/non-inference verification |
| S40 | RuntimeSet & Capability Model — composed immutable runtime manifests, hashes and release validation when deployed |
| S50 | SA↔GF Contract — operation registry, strict bridge consumption and optional PGF-binding readiness |
| S60 | Faithfulness & Planning Invariants — semantic→communication→language probe and exact obligation/reference coverage |
| S70 | Public SDK / CLI / HTTP Surface — importable package, warning-free CLI module execution, and stable public entry points without starting a server |
| S80 | Canonical Validation & Conformance — executes the target repository's own validator in `standard`/`deep` |
| S90 | Adversarial Semantic Invariants — malformed obligations, missing semantics, impossible constraints, deadlines, polarity and operation matrix |
| S100 | RuntimeSet Mutation — hash tampering, failed evidence, missing profiles, ambiguous activation and SA-version mismatch |
| S110 | Bridge & Lexical Adversarial — unconsumed slots/features, contract mismatch, missing concrete grammar and exact-lexeme failures |
| S120 | Determinism & Packaging — repeated/parallel render equality plus wheel build/install/import from a temporary clean copy |

## Runtime semantics

A missing deployed RuntimeSet is a `WARN`, not a source-code failure. SA may be fully valid as
an engine while no real language/profile artifact is present in the checkout.

If a RuntimeSet **is** deployed, LevelUpDiag validates its pinned artifacts and invokes SA's
public runtime release validator. A missing `pgf` Python binding is then `BLOCKED` for
real-language acceptance. If no RuntimeSet is deployed, missing `pgf` is only a `WARN`.

## Python environments / WSL

Target probes run with the target `src` directory on `PYTHONPATH`, so editable installation is
not required for diagnostics. To use WSL from a Windows LevelUpDiag UI, override locally:

```json
{
  "semantik": {
    "python_execution": "wsl",
    "wsl_distro": "Debian",
    "python_executable": "/path/to/python"
  }
}
```

No dependency installation, GF compilation, server startup, or target mutation is performed by
these SemantiK-specific levels.

## Windows UI

`RUN_LEVELUPDIAG_UI.vbs` remains the no-console launcher. The UI reads campaigns from
`levelupdiag_manifest.json`, so it automatically exposes the updated v1 profile.

See `docs/SEMANTIK_ARCHITECT_PROFILE.md` for the exact diagnostic contract.

## Deep adversarial campaign

`deep` is intentionally more expensive than `standard`. It creates all mutation fixtures only in temporary directories and never patches the target checkout. It is intended for pre-release bug hunting and should be run sequentially (`--jobs 1`) when investigating order/state issues.
